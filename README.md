# .nvim
My NeoVim config, originally based off one created by ThePrimeagen, heavily modified for my needs.


## Usage

```bash
$ make help

install: Backup existing nvim configuration and copy current directory structure to nvim config directory
backup: Backup existing nvim configuration
copy: Copy current directory structure to nvim config directory
clean_backups: Delete all backup directories

```
